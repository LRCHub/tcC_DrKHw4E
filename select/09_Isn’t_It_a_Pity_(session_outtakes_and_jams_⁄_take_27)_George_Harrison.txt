Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain?
How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore?
Forgetting to give back
Isn't it a pity?

Now some things take so long
But how do I explain
When not too many people, hmm
Can see we're all the same?
And because of all their tears
But eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
Isn't it a pity?

Isn't it a pity?
Now isn't it a shame
How we break each other's hеart
And cause each other pain?
How wе take each other's love
Without thinking anymore?
Forgetting to give back, hmm
Isn't it a pity?

Do-do-do-do-do
Isn't it a pity?

Now isn't it a pity?
Forgetting to give back
