In front of a fire again
Well, you might think it's fine
Oh, whenever we fight as tangent space
And they sign

Oh, I'm on my way
And feeling it's time to wander
I'm on my way
And feeling it's time to wander

It's mental cabaret
It's dancing with my fate
Oh, your sexy impressions
Left me engaged with a game

Oh, I'm on my way
And feeling it's time to wander
I'm on my way
And feeling it's time to wander

You will find
And you will outshine
And you will shine
And you, oh

Gimme that

All away
And feeling it's time to wander
All away
And feeling it's time to wander

You will find
And you will outshine
And you will shine
And you, oh
